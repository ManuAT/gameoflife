 Implementation of Conway's Game of Life with Java
 
# Introduction:
Conway's Game of Life is a fascinating cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. Despite its simple rules, the game exhibits complex patterns and behaviors, making it a popular topic for computer science enthusiasts and mathematicians alike. In this article, we will explore an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Java, and discuss how the game works and how it can be implemented.
# Understanding the Game of Life:
The Game of Life is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The grid evolves over discrete time steps called generations. The state of each cell in a generation depends on its current state and the states of its eight neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).

# The Rules:
The game follows four simple rules for the evolution of cells:
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
